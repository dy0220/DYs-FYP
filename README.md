# DYs-FYP
This is my personal Final Year Project. It is a python program that encrypts and decrypts .txt and .docx with customizable key/shift and links to AWS S3 Bucket

## Do the following command line in terminal in order to download needed extensions to run the program
> pip install boto3 pycryptodome tkinterdnd2

Download the whole folder [The folder should include 3 .json file and 1 .py file]
**NOTE! THIS PROJECT IS ONLY A SIMPLE PROGRAM WITH ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION FUNCTION! I KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT POSSIBLE!**
